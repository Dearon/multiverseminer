Multiverse Miner

Picks:


Each planet is it's own incremental. You need specific resources from each planet to continue. Each planet has attacks from intergalactic mobs, which serve to halt your progress, and steal the resources of the planet.

if your rig and base is destroyed, you either have to pay an astronomical amount for repair or you wait 24 real life hours for a transport ship to pick you up you must maintain your facilities on each base also, since you need oxygen in space, and earth has the oxygen
the attacks will happen in waves you can buy units to defend and you can also attack the invaders planets, to neutralize them completely then you colonize their planet, and you gain their resources.

[15:50:17]  <Ximni>	 Will you have any info on how strong an attacking wave will be?
[15:50:32]  <@antlong>	 yes, they will be scaled according to your level
[15:50:44]  <@antlong>	 it will never be super easy
[15:50:55]  <@antlong>	 but the thing is you can allocate a lot of resources to building a sick base
